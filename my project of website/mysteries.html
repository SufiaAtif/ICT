     Imagine having a big box of chocolates, but you can't see the chocolates. That's kind of like dark matter. We know it's there because it affects how stars and galaxies move, but we can't see it.

      <h1>The Wow! Signal</h1><br>
      <p>In 1977, a powerful radio signal was detected from deep space.The Wow! Signal is a strong, narrowband radio signal that was detected in 1977 by a radio telescope at Ohio State University.

        <br>  <br><b>When and Where was it Detected?</b><br><br>
        
        The signal was detected on August 15, 1977, at 11:16 PM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT). It was discovered by Dr. Jerry Ehman, a radio astronomer who was working on a project to search for signals from other civilizations.
        The signal was detected by a radio telescope that was scanning the sky for signals. The signal was so strong that it was written down by hand on a printout, with the notation "Wow!" in the margin.
<br>Despite numerous attempts to verify the signal, its origin remains a mystery. Some possible explanations include:
<br><li>Alien Signal</li>
<br><li>Natural Phenomenon</li>
<br><li>Instrumental Error</li><br>After the signal was detected, several attempts were made to verify it, but none were successful. The signal remains one of the most intriguing examples of an unexplained signal in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).

        <h4>The Missing Mass Problem (1900s)</h3>
        <p >Scientists noticed that galaxies were spinning really fast, but they couldn't figure out what was holding them together. It was like there was invisible glue keeping everything stuck.
        </p><br>
      

        <h4>The Cosmic Microwave Background (1960s)</h3>
        <p>Scientists discovered a faint glow of radiation all over the universe. It's like the leftover heat from a big explosion (the Big Bang) that started the universe.
        </p><br>
      
   
        <h4>The Pioneer Anomaly (1970s)</h3>
        <p>Two spacecraft, Pioneer 10 and 11, were sent to explore the universe. But they didn't follow the path scientists expected. It was like an invisible force was pulling them off course.
        </p><br>


        <h4>Dark Energy (1990s)</h3>
        <p>Scientists realized that the universe is expanding (getting bigger) really fast. But they couldn't explain why. It's like the universe is being inflated by a cosmic balloon.</p><br>
        <br>

        <h4>Tabby's Star Dimming (2000s)</h3>
        <p>A star called Tabby's Star was acting weird. It would get dimmer and brighter at random times. Scientists thought maybe something was blocking the star's light, but they couldn't see what it was.
        </p><br>


        <h4> The Oumuamua Object (2010s)
        </h3>
        <p>A strange, cigar-shaped object flew through our solar system. Scientists were excited because it might have come from another galaxy. It was like a cosmic messenger from far, far away.
        </p><br>


        <h4>Water Vapor on Mars (2020s)</h3>
        <p>NASA's Perseverance rover found evidence of water vapor on Mars. This was a big deal because water is essential for life. It's like finding an oasis in the desert!</p><br>
