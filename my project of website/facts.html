        <div class="fact">
            
            <h2 style="font-style: bebas Neue,Sans-serif;">GREAT MASS OF SUN IN SOLAR SYSTEM</h2>

            
            
            <li> The Sun is massive.<b>It accounts for 99.86% of the mass in the solar system</b>.The Sun has a staggering mass of 1.989 × 10³⁰ kilograms. That’s 330,000 times the mass of Earth!
            In simpler terms, it weighs as much as about 333,000 Earths or 1,048 Jupiter-sized planets.The Sun is composed mostly of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%), with trace amounts of heavier elements like oxygen, carbon, and iron.
            <br><li> This composition fuels the Sun’s energy production through nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium in its core.<br>
            
                <br><li> The Sun's immense mass generates a gravitational pull strong enough to keep the entire solar system in check.
At the Sun’s surface, gravity is 28 times stronger than Earth's. A person weighing 70 kg on Earth would weigh about 1,960 kg on the Sun—though they'd be vaporized long before feeling the weight!
        
        <br>
        <li>The Sun's mass is directly related to the energy it produces.<li>
Einstein’s equation, E = mc², explains how a tiny fraction of the Sun’s mass is converted into the staggering energy that powers our solar system.
<br><li>Every second, the Sun loses 4 million tons of mass as it radiates energy into space—enough to power Earth's needs for millions of years!
<br><li>Sun is more massive than about 90% of stars in the Milky Way, as many are smaller red dwarfs.Over the next 5 billion years, the Sun will lose some of its mass as it continues burning hydrogen.
As it becomes a red giant and later a white dwarf, it will shed much of its outer layers, reducing its gravitational hold on the solar system.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">FUN ANALOGY</h2><p><i>If the Sun's mass were converted into money, imagine this:

    If 1 kilogram = $1, the Sun’s total mass would make you a quintillionaire many times over—so rich, the concept of money would collapse!</i>

        <div class="part2"> 
            <h2 style="font-style: bebas Neue,Sans-serif;">The Cosmic Odessey</h2>
<p>
<li><b>There are more stars than grains of sand</b>. The universe has over 200 billion trillion stars.It is because of continuous expansion of universe.
Space expansion is the process by which the universe is continuously growing and evolving. This means that the distance between objects in the universe, such as galaxies, is increasing over time.
<br><li>The exact cause of space expansion is still not fully understood, but it is thought to be driven by a mysterious force known as dark energy. Dark energy is believed to make up approximately 68% of the universe's total energy density.
<br><li>The effects of space expansion are far-reaching and profound. As the universe expands, galaxies move away from each other, and the cosmic microwave background radiation becomes weaker. Eventually, the universe may become so vast that it will be difficult for us to observe distant galaxies and stars.
<br><li>Scientists continue to study space expansion using a variety of methods, including:<br><li>Observing distant galaxies</li>
<br><li>Measuring cosmic microwave background radiation</li>
<br><li>Simulating the universe</li>
<br>As we continue to explore the universe and unravel its secrets, we may uncover new insights into the mechanisms driving space expansion.n conclusion, space expansion is a complex and fascinating phenomenon that continues to captivate human imagination.

            <h2 style="font-style: bebas Neue,Sans-serif;">Neutron star</h2>
            <p>Neutron stars are incredibly fascinating objects in space.   A neutron star is incredibly dense: A sugar-cube-sized piece weighs about a billion tons.
               <br><li>Neutron stars are formed when a massive star undergoes a supernova explosion, collapsing its core into an incredibly dense object.
                As core of the star collapses, causing a massive amount of matter to be compressed into an incredibly small space.
                <br><li>Neutron stars are the <b>densest objects in the universe</b>, with the density of a sugar-cube-sized amount of neutron star material being equivalent to the mass of a mountain.
                    <br><li>Neutron stars have incredibly strong magnetic fields, trillions of times stronger than Earth's magnetic field.
                        <br><li>Neutron stars can rotate incredibly fast, with some spinning hundreds of times per second.
                            <br> <li> Neutron stars are incredibly hot, with surface temperatures reaching millions of degrees Celsius.
                                Neutron stars can be detected by observing X-rays and gamma rays emitted by their hot surfaces and magnetic fields.Neutron stars can be detected by observing X-rays and gamma rays emitted by their hot surfaces and magnetic fields.
They can also be detected by radio waves and gravitational wave detectors.

        <h2 style="font-style: bebas Neue,Sans-serif;">Black Holes</h2>
        <p>
           <li><i> A black hole is a region in space where the gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.Black holes are invisible: They can only be detected by their effect on nearby matter.
            <br> <li>  A black hole is formed when a massive star dies and collapses in on itself. The gravity becomes so strong that it creates a black hole.
                <br>  <br> <li>  If you get too close to a black hole, you'll get pulled in by the strong gravity. The gravity will stretch and squeeze you like playdough, and eventually, you'll be trapped forever.
                    <br> <li> We can't see black holes because they're invisible. The gravity is so strong that not even light can escape, so we can't see them.
                       <b> The intense gravity of a black hole can stretch and eventually tear apart objects that get too close.</b>
                        Telescopes can detect X-rays and gamma rays emitted by hot gas swirling around black holes.Scientists detect black holes by looking for X-rays and gamma rays that are emitted by hot gas swirling around them. They also detect gravitational waves that are produced when black holes collide.
                        <br> <br>  <li>  Black holes are not dangerous to us because they're really far away. We're safe, but it's still important to learn about them and how they work.
                            <br> <li> Black holes distort spacetime, creating a gravitational pull that affects nearby objects.
                                <br><br> <li> Time passes slower near a black hole due to its strong gravity. <br> <br>

<div class="fact">
    <h2 style="font-style: bebas Neue,Sans-serif;">Largest Volcano In Solar System</h2><br><h3 style="text-align: center;">Olympus Mons</h3>
    <p>The largest volcano is on Mars: Olympus Mons is three times taller than Mount Everest.
        Olympus Mons is around 3 times the size of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth. It stands at an impressive 27 km high and has a base that's over 600 km wide.


<br><li>Olympus Mons is a shield volcano, which means it's shaped like a shield. It's made up of layers of lava that have built up over time. Olympus Mons is also incredibly old, with estimates suggesting it formed around 2 billion years ago.

    <br><li><b>How Was Olympus Mons Formed?</b><br>
Olympus Mons was formed when lava flowed out of Mars' interior and built up around a volcanic vent. Over time, the lava flows stacked up, creating the massive volcano we see today.

Olympus Mons is considered a dormant volcano, which means it's no longer actively erupting. However, scientists believe it may have erupted in the past and could potentially erupt again in the future.

<br><li>Olympus Mons provides scientists with valuable insights into Mars' geological history and the planet's internal structure. Studying Olympus Mons can also help us better understand how volcanoes form and evolve on other plans.

<div class="part2"><h1 style="font-style: bebas Neue,Sans-serif;">Saturn can Float ON Water</h2> <p>Saturn can float on water. Its density is so low it would float in a big enough body of water.
<br><br>
Saturn is a gas giant planet, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium gases. Due to its unique composition and structure, Saturn has a remarkably low density.
<br><br>
<li>Density of Saturn: approximately 0.687 g/cm³<br>
<li>Density of water: approximately 1.000 g/cm³<br>

<b>Since Saturn's density is lower than that of water, it would indeed float on water if it were possible to place the entire planet in a gigantic bathtub!

        <div class="fact"> <h2 style="font-style: bebas Neue,Sans-serif;">RECESSION of MOON</h3><br>
            <p>
                The Moon is indeed moving away from Earth at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters (1.5 inches) per year.<br>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Evidence</h3>
               <br> <b> Tidal interactions:</b>The gravitational pull between Earth and the Moon causes tidal interactions. As the Moon orbits Earth, it creates tidal bulges in our oceans. This interaction slows down Earth's rotation and causes the Moon to move away.
               <br><b> Laser ranging:</b> Scientists have used laser ranging to measure the Moon's distance since the 1960s. By bouncing lasers off mirrors left on the Moon's surface during the Apollo missions, researchers have accurately measured the Moon's increasing distance.
               <br><b>Seafloor spreading:</b> The rate of seafloor spreading, which is the process by which new oceanic crust is created, is consistent with the Moon's recession.
<i>
    <br> <b> <li>Rate of recession: 3.8 cm/year (1.5 in/year)</b>
        <br> <b><li> Moon's current distance: approximately 384,400 km (238,900 miles)</b>
            <br> <b><li>Moon's distance 620 million years ago: approximately 350,000 km (217,500 miles)</b>
               </i><br>

               The Moon's recession is a result of the tidal interactions between Earth and the Moon. As the Moon orbits Earth, it causes tidal bulges in our oceans. This interaction slows down Earth's rotation, which in turn causes the Moon to move away.

            <h2 style="font-style: bebas Neue,Sans-serif;">The Great Red Spot</h2><br><p>
            
            Jupiter’s Great Red Spot is a giant storm. It's been raging for over 300 years.The storm is huge! It's big enough to fit several Earths inside it.
            he storm looks red because of special gases in Jupiter's air.

<br><br><b> How Long Has It Been Going On?</b><br>
<i>The Great Red Spot has been going on for over 150 years. That's even longer than cars have been around!</i>

<br>
Scientists think the storm is special because Jupiter's air is moving really fast. This makes the storm keep going.
<br>
Yes, we can see the Great Red Spot from Earth. It looks like a big red spot on Jupiter.

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><u>Amazing Facts</u></h3>
- The Great Red Spot is getting smaller.
<br>- It's really deep, going down into Jupiter's air for hundreds of miles.

 <div class="fact"><h2 style="font-style: bebas Neue,Sans-serif;">Coldest Place In Solar System</h2><p>
     <i>The coldest place in the universe is a lab on Earth: NASA's Cold Atom Lab (CAL) is colder than space.</i><br>
     The CAL is a special laboratory on the International Space Station (ISS) that can make things really, really cold.

<br><br><b> How cold can it get?</b><br><br>
The CAL can make things colder than space itself! Space is already very cold, but the CAL can make things as cold as -273.15°C (-459.67°F).

<br>
<li>The CAL uses special machines that can slow down the movement of tiny particles called atoms. When atoms move slowly, they get colder. The CAL can slow down these atoms so much that they get even colder than the coldness of space.
<br>
<br>
<li>Scientists use the CAL to study how things behave at extremely cold temperatures. This helps them understand the rules of physics and how the universe works.
